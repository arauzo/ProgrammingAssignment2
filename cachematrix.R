## Matrix object with a cached inverse function

## Create a matrix object with support for cached inverse calculation
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Calculate the inverse of matrix x, using a cache if inverse has been previously calculated.
cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {

            ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
